    <p> Hello, i am Stoyan Goshev. I am 23 years old. From 1st to 7th grade I studied at the Vasil Levski school in the village of Kolarovo. From 8th to 12th grade I studied at Asen Zlatarov Vocational School in the town of Petrich. From 10 to 19 years old I practiced martial arts.</p>
    <p> My interest in IT technology started after I finished school. There was an advertisement for a course on "Basics of computer networks". Last year from September to December I tried 2 times to take a course on Javascript basics in SoftUni but unsuccessfully. Programmers I know told me their program is wrong because it is better to start learning html & css before JavaScript. In this course work with "if-else; switch-case; for & while loop" they were not very difficult. Working with arrays was much more difficult. So I searched in the Internet other courses so I came to your course in "Progressbg.net". I would like very much to start working either after the first or after the second course. My aim is to complete the entire web design course including courses for PHP & SQL. For a course project I would very much like to make an official website of the hut we have - mountain hut Kongur.</p>
